# flutterby

Welcome to **flutterby**, a collection of projects, experiments, and notes as I master Flutter and Dart from scratch.

This repo is my personal Flutter playground.
Every commit represents a new concept, widget, or project Iâ€™ve learned, from basic UI building blocks to advanced app architectures.
